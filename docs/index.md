# Introduction

**Omuk Inc.** is a company (definitely it isn't) to keep two high school graduates' funner projects all sorted.

Well, those are fun projects but definitely not unprofessional. Using the tools from the gods of Silicon Valley, all our projects are crafted with enough efforts to unleash the powers of a computer making the users stunned.



# Team Members

**Omuk Inc.** team consists of two supreme procrastinators freshly baked out of Notre Dame College, Dhaka with one being the appreciator of beauty while the other pretending to be a craftsman. Meet [Sakirul Alam Sakir](https://github.com/BinarySakir) and [Rafeed M. Bhuiyan](https://github.com/roughweed) being the Apollo and Hephaestus of the company.

# Projects

### Banglamemes

The idea of collecting the Bangladeshi meme culture under one platform was a nice idea but never made into reality because of not having a credit card, hence a failed startup.

Though the site was never live on production, you can check out the test version hosted on Heroku. Obviously you would not be able to view most of the features unless you log in.
In case you really are interested, contact us for the credentials.
